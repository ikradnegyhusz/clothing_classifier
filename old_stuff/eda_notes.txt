Reduction of dimensions to 2 -> scatterplot -> the classes are already identifiable to some degree
Reduction of dimensions to 3 -> scatterplot -> the classes are already identifiable to some degree

The classes are evenly split in the train data (~same number of images per class)
The mean and standard deviation of images (pixel values) don't have any predictive power.
Purely using pixel intensity might not be enough to differentiate between the classes.
